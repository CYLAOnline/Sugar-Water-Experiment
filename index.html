    <h1>The Fundamental Process of Science</h1>
    <h4>The Scientific Method</h4>
    <p><b>
        Have you ever wondered how scientists are able to develop all of the things they do?<br/>
        The process is quite simple and it is called the scientific method. The scientific method<br/>
        consists of six steps: <br/>
    </b></p>
        (1) Asking a question based on observation. <br/>
        (2) Formulating a hypothesis or educated guess. <br/>
        (3) Conducting an experiment. <i>Note: An experiment has three types of variables.</i> <br/>
        <ul>
            <li>Controlled Variable -- The variables in an experiment that are held constant</li>
            <li>Independent Variable -- The variable that is intentionally manipulated</li>
            <li>Dependent Variable -- The variable that is held as a function of the independent variable</li>
        </ul>
        (4) Analyzing data <br/>
        (5) Formulating a conclusion <br/>
        (6) Communicating results to an audience <br/>
    <p><b>
        Let's dive deep into the scientific method through exemplifying with the classic sugar in water example.
    </b></p>

    <br/>

    <h2>What's the Scenario?</h2>
    <img style="width: 500px; height: 500px;" src="sugar-water.jpg" alt="Sugar and Water">
    <p>
        It's a hot summer day and you decide to go play tennis with one of your tennis buddies. <br/>
        You dissolve some sugar in some water that you got from the fridge, which is very cold. It takes <br/>
        a decent amount of time to dissolve. You then decide to use water from the faucet which is room temperature <br/>
        and this time it does not take as long to dissolve. Curious as to why this occured, you text your tennis buddy <br/>
        and cancel the appointment as your scientific mind has just been activated.
    </p>

    <h4>Step One: Asking a Question Based on Observation</h4>
    <p>
        Probed by this seemingly strange occurance, you ask yourself: <br/><br/>
        <i>
            Why did the sugar dissolve faster in the water that was of high temperature?<br/>
            Could it be that sugar dissolves faster as temperature increases?
        </i>
    </p>

    <h4>Step Two: Formulating a Hypothesis</h4>
    <p>
        As the old saying goes, fortune favors the bold. You decide that the temperature increase <br/>
        of the water lead to the increase in dissolvation rate of the sugar. You form the following <br/>
        hypothesis in the form of an IF/THEN statement: <br/><br/>

        <i>
            If I increase the temperature of the water, the sugar will dissolve faster
        </i>
    </p>

    <h4>Step Three: Conducting an Experiment</h4>
    <p>
        Now that the hypothesis has been formed, you decide to set up an experiment in congruence with <br/>
        with the guidelines of the scientific method.
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>
                    Controlled Variables
                </th>
                <th>
                    Indepdent Variable
                </th>
                <th>
                    Dependent Variable
                </th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Sugar Brand</li>
                        <li>Cup Type</li>
                        <li>Water Volume</li>
                    </ul>
                </td>
                <td>
                    Water Temperature
                </td>
                <td>
                    Sugar Dissolvation Rate
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        Simply put, you have three cups of 1L of water, one at 0 degrees, 37 degrees, and 100 degrees. You dissolve <br/>
        the same volume of sugar in each cup and time the time it takes to dissolve.
    </p>

    <h4>Step Four: Analyzing Data</h4>
    <p>
         The results are tabulated as follows: <br/>
    
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>
                    Cup #
                </th>
                <th>
                    Temperature (Celsius)
                </th>
                <th>
                    Volume of Water (L)
                </th>
                <th>
                    Dissolvation Time (s)
                </th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    One
                </td>
                <td>
                    0
                </td>
                <td>
                    1
                </td>
                <td>
                    45 
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    Two
                </td>
                <td>
                    37
                </td>
                <td>
                    1 
                </td>
                <td>
                    18 
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    Three
                </td>
                <td>
                    100
                </td>
                <td>
                        1
                </td>
                <td>
                    3 
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <br/>
        The temperature of 0 degrees yielded a dissolvation rate of 45 seconds<br/>
        The temperature of 37 degrees yielded a dissolvation rate of 18 seconds<br/>
        The temperature of 100 degrees yielded a dissolvation rate of 3 seconds<br/>
    </p>

    <h4>Step Five: Forming a Conclusion</h4>
    <p>
        Based on the data, you conclude that your hypothesis was correct.<br/>
        As temperature increases, the dissolvation rate of sugar increases as well.
    </p>

    <h2>Step Six: Communicating Your Results</h2>
    <p>
        After 45 minutes your experiment is complete. You run off to the tennis court and tell your tennis buddy <br/>
        what you have just learned.
